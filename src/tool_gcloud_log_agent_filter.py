    The `gcloud_logging_read_command` tool provides intelligent log analysis capabilities:

    ### Usage
    ```python
    gcloud_logging_read_command(
        project_id="your-project-id",
        query="resource.type=k8s_container",
        start_time="2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",

        ai_analyse_for_goal="Find errors related to pod scheduling"
    )
    ```

    ### Features
    - Fetches logs from Google Cloud Logging based on query and time range
    - Processes logs in pages of 100 entries
    - Uses AI to analyze each page for relevance to your goal
    - Returns only relevant information, filtering out noise
    - Automatically handles log entry conversion and formatting

    ### Example Goals
    - "Find errors related to pod scheduling failures"
    - "Identify performance issues with container restarts"  
    - "Look for authentication or authorization problems"
    - "Find logs related to memory or CPU resource constraints"
